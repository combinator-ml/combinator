# Introduction

Combinator stacks are built from two or more [components](../components/introduction.md). A stack represents a common combination of tools to provide end-to-end ML functionality.

A specific stack is formed from an opinionated selection of [components](../components/introduction.md), so there may be cross-over between stacks.
