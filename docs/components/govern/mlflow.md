## Introduction

[MLFlow](https://mlflow.org) is an open-source model registry and experiment tracker. Data scientists leverage this hosted service to store the results of their experiments and persist final artifacts like model parameters and weights.

This provides a centralised catalogue of models and experiments, which is useful for organizational purposes and sharing work.

MLFlow also comes with limited serving capabilities, although that is not it's core aim.

## Test Drive

The fastest way to get started is to use the test drive functionality provided by [TestFaster](https://testfaster.ci). Click on the "Launch Test Drive" button below (opens a new window).
